I spent many years in the E-commerce and financial domain until my current role. My first engineering job as a full-time engineer was in cloud infrastructure with AWS and Nifty Cloud. Then, as a backend engineer, I joined the payment team at BASE, one of the biggest E-commerce platforms in Japan. After that, I was transferred to a subordinate company that offered financial services at the early stage as first engineers. I was promoted to Tech Lead, and Enginnering Manager of 10 team members.
